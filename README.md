# Trash-Bank

## Inspiration

The world generates 2.01 billion tons of municipal solid waste annually, with at least 60% percent of that recyclable. But only 35% of the waste is recycled while the rest finds its way to landfills. Worldwide, waste generated per person per day averages 0.74 kilogram but ranges widely, from 0.11 to 4.54 kilograms. When looking forward, global waste is expected to grow to 3.40 billion tons by 2050, more than double population growth over the same period. Improper waste disposal methods like open dumping, causes soil and water contamination. Unmanaged or poorly managed waste contaminates the environment, harms both animals and humans, and can even affect the economic development of a region.

## What it does

Trash bank is a decentralized waste recycling platform. A user can buy or sell recyclable waste like paper, plastic, metal and glass through a web application developed by us. When a user uploads an image of waste to be sold, it gets classified into the above four types of wastes. We have trained a neural network to classify the images. After classifying the image, we are using a regression model to predict its weight and price. Thus, a user can upload an image and will automatically get its type, weight and price. Other users can thus search and view the images of the waste they want to buy. Users can buy the waste in a trustless decentralized way using smart contacts which we have deployed using Ethereum. In this way waste can be recycled, and users can also earn money via cryptocurrencies. This will in turn reduce the stress on landfills and help in sustainable development.
